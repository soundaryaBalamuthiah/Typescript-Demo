What is TypeScript?
-language by microsoft
-was built to replace JS
-super set for JS
-generates the most optimised JS code
-declare the type of variable 
-it is typesafe unlike JS which is not typesafe
-no compile time error but it exists in typescript
-transpilation is the process of converting TS ---> js 

write it once, upgrade to anything to js version.

ES5 and ES6

(ts file-->js file)to create a js file from ts file: 
1.run tsc filename

to run a js file : node filename
node-runtime for JS

we have to convert the ts file to js file since the browsers can only understand js files not typescript.
